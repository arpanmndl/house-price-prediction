# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques




<!-- ### 2. Description
Provide a brief description of your project. Explain what it does, why it exists, and any other relevant information.-->

## Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Practice Skills
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
